                        web
                        applications. -->
                        Hello, I'm  <b>Chitra Pandey</b>, and I am currently pursuing <b>Btech</b> in <b>computer science</b> <b>3rd year</b>. I have a strong
                        foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. I am currently enrolled in <b>ABES Engineering College 
                            Ghazaiabad</b>. I have taken courses in Computer Science, which have
                        equipped me with a solid understanding of software development principles. I am proficient in a variety of programming
                        languages and I have hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end
                        technologies. My skills include <b>Mern technologies, databases</b> and programming languages such as <b>C++, Python, javascript</b>. I have worked on
                        various projects like <b>book publishing platform</b>and <b>women safety system</b>, where I was responsible for frontend and backend developer.
                        These experiences have allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and enhance my
                        problem-solving abilities. Full-stack
                        development appeals to me because it allows me to be involved in every aspect of the software development lifecycle,
                        from designing user interfaces to optimizing server performance. In the dynamic field of technology, I understand the importance of staying updated, and I am always eager
                        to expand my skill set to meet the evolving demands of the industry. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my
                        skills and passion to a startup environment. 
                        <!-- I believe my technical proficiency, coupled with my eagerness to learn and
                        adapt, makes me a valuable asset for any team looking to make an impact in the world of technology. -->
